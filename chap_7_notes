Prompts
`prompt' field asks the user for some 
information and provides a response field for her answer.

var spec = prompt("Your species?", "human")

the first parameter is the `information' and the second prompt, is the 'response' field which can be changed and "also captured in a variable"

* `prompt` also gives you a way to capture a response, SO START by declaring a VARIABLE.


* You can specify a second string, and include a default response that will appear in the display field. 

var question = "How many cards do I have";
var answer = 2;
var solution = prompt(question,answer);
var newAnswer = solution + 3;
alert(solution);
alert(newAnswer);
clear();
