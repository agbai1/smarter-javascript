### CHAPTPER 15
#### Arrays
* array is a variable type
* arrays hold multiple values assigned to it of different data types. 
e.g. var cities = ["Aba", "Umuahia", "Port-Harcourt"];

var question = "The first city is on the list is ";

alert(question + cities[0]);

var answer = prompt(question);

city[0] = answer;

alert("The first city is on the list as changed to " + cities[0]);

** The first item in an array always has an index of 0, not 1 **

### CHAPTER 16
#### Adding and removing array elements

* declaring an empty array 
	`var emptyArray = [];

	`pop` keyword removes the last element of an array
	`push` keyword can be sued to add one or more elements to the end of an array.

	Test Function: Create a function that lets people dynamically add city names to an array.

var question = "What is the name of your City? ";

var cities = [];

var num = prompt("How many people will be answering?");

while(cities.length < num){
  var answer = prompt(question);
  cities.push(answer);
}

for (var count = 0; count < cities.length; count++) {
  alert("The name of City number " + (count+1) + " City is: " + cities[count]);
}


### CHAPTER 17
#### Removing and Inserting elements in Array

* `arrayName.shift();` removes the first element

* `arrayName.unshift("item1", "item2");` adds one or more elements at the beginning of an array

* `arrayName.splice(2,2,"item1toAdd", "item2toAdd")` - this mehods tells the compiler to add the items after the second element and delete 2 elements after.

e.g. 
var pets = ["cat", "dog", "pig", "cow", "lizard","bird", "tiger"];

for (var count = 0; count < pets.length; count++) {
	alert("The name of pet number " + (count+1) + " is " + pets[count]);
} //displays all the pets in the array before pet 1 shift

alert(pets.length); // 7 at this time

pets.shift(); // removes cat from the array.

alert(pets.length); // 6 at this time

for (var count = 0; count < pets.length; count++) {
	alert("The name of pet number " + (count+1) + " is " + pets[count]);
} //displays all the pets in the array after pet 1 shift


pets.splice(1, 3, "hen", "fish", "pigeon", "goat"); // I think hen, fish, pigeon, and goat are added after dog and "pig", "cow", "lizard" are deleted from array

alert(pets.length);

for (var count = 0; count < pets.length; count++) {
	alert("The name of pet number " + (count+1) + " is " + pets[count]);
} //displays all the pets in the array after more is added and some are taken off
//order should be dog, hen, fish, pigeon, goat, bird and tiger

pet.splice(3,1); "Tells the compiler to delete 1 element after the 3 item in the array. "

`var newPets = pets.splice(2,4);` creates a new Array
called newPets and then stores the deleted arrays 
pet in it.
